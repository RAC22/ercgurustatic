      <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <br />
      <h5>General Terms:</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>Terms and conditions</strong> These terms and conditions
        ("Agreement") set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of
        the ercguru.com website ("Website" or "Service") and any of its related
        products and services (collectively, "Services"). This Agreement is
        legally binding between you ("User", "you" or "your") and ERC GURU ("ERC
        Guru", "we", "us" or "our"). By accessing and using the Website and
        Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to
        be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you are entering into this
        Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent
        that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in
        which case the terms "User", "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity.
        If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms
        of this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and may not access
        and use the Website and Services. You acknowledge that this Agreement is
        a contract between you and ERC Guru, even though it is electronic and is
        not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Website and
        Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Billing and payments</strong> You shall pay all fees or charges
        to your account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms
        in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. Where Services
        are offered as a free analysis, payment may be required after the free
        analysis is provided, and not when you enter your billing details (which
        may be required prior to providing the free analysis). If, in our
        judgment, your purchase constitutes a high-risk transaction, we will
        require you to provide us with a copy of your valid government-issued
        photo identification, and possibly a copy of a recent bank statement for
        the credit or debit card used for the purchase. We reserve the right to
        change products and product pricing at any time. We also reserve the
        right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole
        discretion, limit or cancel any order.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Accuracy of information</strong> Occasionally there may be
        information on the Website that contains typographical errors,
        inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to product descriptions,
        pricing, availability, promotions and offers. We reserve the right to
        correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or update
        information or cancel orders if any information on the Website or
        Services is inaccurate at any time without prior notice (including after
        you have submitted your order). We undertake no obligation to update,
        amend or clarify information on the Website including, without
        limitation, pricing information, except as required by law. No specified
        update or refresh date applied on the Website should be taken to
        indicate that all information on the Website or Services has been
        modified or updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Links to other resources</strong> Although the Website and
        Services may link to other resources (such as websites, mobile
        applications, etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any
        approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any
        linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We are not
        responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the
        offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their
        resources. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the
        actions, products, services, and content of any other third parties. You
        should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use
        of any resource which you access through a link on the Website and
        Services. Your linking to any other off-site resources is at your own
        risk.

        or equivalent rights or forms of protection and any other results of
        intellectual activity which subsist or will subsist now or in the future
        in any part of the world. This Agreement does not transfer to you any
        intellectual property owned by ERC Guru or third parties, and all
        rights, titles, and interests in and to such property will remain (as
        between the parties) solely with ERC Guru. All trademarks, service

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limitation of liability</strong> To the fullest extent permitted
        by applicable law, in no event will ERC Guru, its affiliates, directors,
        officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any
        person for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, cover or
        consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages for lost
        profits, revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business,
        business interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business
        opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability, including,
        without limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty,
        negligence or otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to
        the possibility of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To
        the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability
        of ERC Guru and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers
        and licensors relating to the services will be limited to an amount
        greater of one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you to ERC
        Guru for the prior one month period prior to the first event or
        occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and exclusions
        also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses
        or fails of its essential purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Indemnification</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold ERC
        Guru and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
        suppliers and licensors harmless from and against any liabilities,
        losses, damages or costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred
        in connection with or arising from any third party allegations, claims,
        actions, disputes, or demands asserted against any of them as a result
        of or relating to your Content, your use of the Website and Services or
        any willful misconduct on your part.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Severability</strong> All rights and restrictions contained in
        this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and binding only
        to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are
        intended to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not
        render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any
        provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to
        be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
        jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining
        provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with
        respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions
        or portions thereof shall remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <p>

        performance of this Agreement and any disputes arising out of it shall
        be governed by the substantive and procedural laws of Utah, United
        States without regard to its rules on conflicts or choice of law and, to
        the extent applicable, the laws of United States. The exclusive
        jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof
        shall be the courts located in Utah, United States, and you hereby
        submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. You hereby waive any
        right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to
        this Agreement. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the

      <br />
      <h5>Additional Terms:</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>Accuracy of Submission:</strong> We analyze and generate your
        ERC analysis based upon the information provided during the qualifying
        submission process. You certify that all information you have provided
        is accurate to the best of your knowledge and agree to hold ERC Guru and
        its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and
        licensors harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages or
        costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred as a result of
        inaccuracies on your ERC filing as a results of inaccurate information
        provided to us during the qualification submission. ERC Guru will keep
        record of all responses received during the qualification submission, as
        well as any additional information received after the initial
        qualification submission.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Guarantee:</strong> We are engaging due to our ability to help
        clients navigate and file for the ERC tax credits available under the
        CARES act. We charge reasonable fees for this process. We also provide a
        complementary discovery process to help determine the qualification for
        ERC tax credits before engaging in services. If during the discovery
        effort it is determined that no credit can reasonably be qualified for
        under the law, no fees will be charged and any deposits will be
        returned.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Services:</strong> This agreement is for the scope of services
        that includes only tax work by ERC Guru. This work may include
        navigating laws and rules affecting the client, filing, and financial
        forecasting. In the scope of our tax work we seek to identify the most
        favorable opportunities allowable under the IRC to arrange personal,
        business, or estate affairs so as to minimize various taxes owed by the
        taxpayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Information:</strong> All the work that we do requires
        substantial access to client information. It is the responsibility of
        the client to provide full and timely information - and it is our
        responsibility to ask clearly for all such information. We hold all
        information in total privacy to the client. Only personnel performing
        the actual services agreed upon have access to client information. We
        are also willing to return and remove all records of any client
        information upon request from said client.
      </p>
      <p>
        Client information includes documents and records, correspondence, and
        intangible information such as trade secrets, business relationships,
        processes, intellectual property and all other forms of proprietary
        client information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tax Law:</strong> In providing tax services we always seek to
        remain safely in the realm of tax law. All advice we provide is to the
        best of our knowledge within the lawful scope allowable under the IRC.
        In the case of newly issued laws, and infrequently in the case of more
        established ones, the IRS may provide case rulings that interpret,
        clarify, restrict, or expand the written law. These rulings provide a
        precedence for safe processes. In the absence of such precedence, we
        follow the law as best it can be interpreted.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are always prepared to explain any tax law to any client or associate
        of such client. We never move forward with any execution until
        understanding and consent is satisfactorily achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Audit:</strong> When a client we have advised comes under audit
        by a taxing authority, unless otherwise specified in our agreement, we
        are willing to provide documentation and assistance to provide the best
        case conceivable for our client. While we cannot guarantee the results
        of any audit, we can provide an explanation of the lawfulness of the
        course taken, sound documentation, and willingness to work directly with
        the client through the process to seek favorable results. When planning
        is done in this way, it is our experience that audits are fair. We do
        not issue tax opinion or shelters - all our work is based on
        well-established law directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Errors:</strong> When an error is identified, we are committed
        to making it known immediately to our client and providing a path for
        resolution. If the error was clerical or otherwise due to incorrect
        process on our part, we seek to fix it to the full extent of our ability
        without requiring additional fees for service. If the error is due to a
        material omission or refusal to provide information on the part of a
        client, we may need to negotiate terms of resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tax Deposits:</strong> All money owed to taxing authorities will
        be clearly outlined in our planning process. It is then the
        responsibility of the client to ensure such taxes are paid timely,
        except in the case where we also provide deposit services. All money
        received via refund from a taxing authority is outside of our control in
        terms of timing of payments. We will take all best efforts to ensure all
        required documentation is in good order so as not to slow any payment or
        refund processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Goodwill/Good Faith:</strong> In all affairs, we will seek to do
        what is best for our clients. We are in good will and faith to seek to
        help every client successfully reduce their tax liability by all legal
        means available to them. We seek to avoid any practice that will bring
        any unnecessary burden or difficulty to our clients by understanding
        their business and seeking to act prudently to protect and assist in its
        success.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>ERC Credit Additional Details:</h5>
      <p>
        The Employee Retention Credit - as released March 12, 2020 and amended
        Dec 27, 2020 - in place to provide incentive to employers who wish to
        keep their employees on payroll despite difficulty due to COVID-19. A
        brief description is available here, not as a matter of advice, but just
        to promote understanding of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        ERC Guru provides all of the required services to file forms,
        amendments, registration, or otherwise needed forms to submit all
        required documentation in good order.
      </p>
      <p>Businesses qualify for this credit based on one of:</p>
      <br />
      <p>Loss of Revenue</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        2020: 50% quarter over quarter reduction in gross sales for 2020 vs 2019
      </p>
      <p>
        2021: 20% quarter over quarter reduction in gross sales for 2021 vs 2019
        or 2020 vs 2021
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>OR</p>
      <br />
      <p>Full or partial shutdown</p>
      <p>
        Of the client business due to legitimate government orders that restrict
        business in a substantial way.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Available Credit:</p>
      <p>
        2020: 50% credit on up to $10,000 of wages per employee for the entire
        year. This means a maximum credit of $5,000 per employee in 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        2021: 70% credit on up to $10,000 of wages per employee per quarter
        through Dec 31. This means a maximum credit of $7,000 per quarter due.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are the numbers we will use to determine your qualification -
        actual numbers are a close estimate. When filing the tax forms, it is
        not uncommon to see small differences or to find new opportunities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>Additional Items to Note:</h5>
      <p>
        Generally payroll is a cost that your business is already incurring.
        Here is a factor of what taxes are remitted for each $10,000 qualifying
        amount. If taxes were not remitted prior to our filing, it is not
        usually expected that additional cash costs will be incurred, but rather
        the IRS will deduct the taxes that would have been owed from the total
        credit.
